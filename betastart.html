<p>There are multiple ways to try the RecordService Beta. First, download the server via the Virtual Machine (VM) or by downloading the RecordServiceClient parcel or package.</p>

<p>RecordService Beta must be installed only on a test cluster, since it is beta software.</p>

<p>To integrate the RecordService into your existing MapReduce and Spark jobs, use the RecordService Client libraries. The client repository contains many example applications you can start running right away.</p>

<p>See <a href="/examples.html">RecordService Examples</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-the-beta-vm">Use the Beta VM</h2>

<p>The RecordService Beta VM provides a single-node Hadoop cluster, including Impala, MapReduce/YARN, Spark, Sentry, and RecordService.  Using the VM is the easiest way to see RecordService in action, and it does not require that you make use of an existing Hadoop cluster.</p>

<p>The VM itself does not contain RecordService Client and examples: those should be run on a separate machine.</p>

<p>See <a href="/vm.html">Download and Install the RecordService VM</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-recordservice-on-an-existing-hadoop-cluster">Use RecordService on an Existing Hadoop Cluster</h2>

<p>This requires a cluster running CDH 5.4.</p>

<p>See <a href="/install.html">Download and Install RecordService</a>.</p>

<p>Run some of the examples to see how programs can read data from RecordService, and to see how Sentry column- and row-level permissions are enforced on MapReduce and Spark jobs.</p>
