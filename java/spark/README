This builds to a jar which contains the RecordServiceRDD. To use,
start spark shell and pass the record service spark jar.

example:
bin/spark-shell --jars $IMPALA_HOME/record-service/java/spark/target/recordservice-spark-0.1.jar

scala> import com.cloudera.recordservice.spark._
scala> val data = sc.recordServiceRecords("select * from tpch.nation")
 finished: count at <console>:18, took 0.617566 s
scala> data.count()
res0: Long = 25
