This repo contains examples of applications built using RecordService client APIs.

  - RSCat: output tabular data for any data set readable by RecordService

  - SumQueryBenchmark: This is an example of running a simple sum over a column,
    pushing the scan to RecordService.

  - Terasort: terasort ported to RecordService. See README in package for more
    details. This also demonstrates how to implement a custom InputFormat using
    the RecordService APIs.

  - MapredColorCount/MapreduceAgeCount/MapReduceColorCount: These are the examples
    ported from Apache Avro and demonstrate the steps required to port an existing
    Avro-based MapReduce job to use RecordService.

  - RecordCount/Wordcount: More simple MapReduce applications that demonstrate some
    of the other InputFormats that are included in the client library.
