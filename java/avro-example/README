This project contains examples of existing avro applications. We should
make sure that these applications can run. When modifying the examples
to use RecordService, leave the original code in with block comments
(which are generally frowned upon) and note the changes that were made.

This should serve to both help us and our users the migration path. Our
goal should be to add as many examples as is reasonable.
